Possible next additions:

- Add Hover popups for `PUB` and `PRI` method signature (help text)

### - Known Issues w/v1.7.2

- We haven't yet learned how to control the ending position of the edit cursor. So in many cases when using selection, not an insert point, the cursor may end up not being where you might expect it to be after pressing TAB or Shift+TAB. We are looking into how to solve this. Even tho' this problem exists the formatting ability this new service provides is well worth this minor headache. We will keep looking for a means to get this under control.
- The single-quote comment (now only on debug statements) is being handled by the semantic (vs. syntactic) parser this is causing external VSCode extensions to do brace, parenthesis, and bracket paring to be marked within trailing line comments on debug lines
- Syntax highlight of DAT section sometimes fails... (although it is less often now...)
- Semantic highlight: the 'modification' attribute is being over-applied, should use more than := as test!!!!
- _I'm sure there are more issues..._

## [1.7.1] 2022-12-05

Update to keyboard mapping: All key mapping now reenabled and Align mode now fully functional

- Fixed: Backspace and Delete now working correctly in Align Mode

- This TAB support **Spin2 Elastic Tab Stops** provides two new settings:
  - **Spin2 Elastic Tab Stops**:`Blocks`: is where the tab stops are listed for each section
  - **Spin2 Elastic Tab Stops**:`Enable`: checkbox which is by default NOT enabled</br>(_As this is an early release this feature is not enabled by default. You must enable and then restart vscode_)
  - These settings are global but can be edited and made custom per project as well

### - Known Issues w/v1.6.0

- We haven't yet learned how to control the ending postion of the edit cursor. So in many cases when using selection not single insert point the cursor may end up not being where you might expect it to be after pressing TAB or Shift+TAB. We are looking into how to solve this.

The Official Release of Semantic Highlighting

In this release we clean things up a bit more, we deliver unknown name highlighting in brighter red, and **herein** we report on the state of testing against various code-sets.

**NOTE:** _with this new **unknown names** coloring feature we were able to find two files that shouldn't compile due to undefined symbols but actually do compile. The findings are being reported to Chip. The author of the files confirmed that the two files are missing symbols._

Semantic Adjustments:

- NEW FEATURE! **Unknown names** in the file are now highlighted with noticable bright red
- BUGFIX: pasm - repaired variable/label hightlight when short names
- BUGFIX: by default the compiler treats the first lines in the file as being in CON, this highlighter does now as well.
- BUGFIX: recognize round(), float(), and trunc() in DAT, CON and PUB/PRI
- BUGFIX: built-in constants should now be colored correctly

Syntax Adjustments:

- BUGFIX: adjusted built-in symbol recognition, now independent of case
- BUGFIX: added missing, newly added to PNut, `DEBUG_*` variables

### - Known Issues w/v1.0.0

- Syntax missing `recv` symbol (but has `send`)
- debug() statements that don't use double-quoted strings currently can't be parsed
- Syntax highlight of DAT section sometimes fails... RES and FIT not colored correctly
- Semantic highlight: the 'modification' attribute is being over-applied, should use more than := as test!!!!
- _I'm sure there are more issues..._

### REPORT: Source code shipped with PNut

- **LIMITATIONs**: all highlighting is working with the exception of:
- FILE `Spin2_interpreter.spin2` - breaks the syntax highlighter, but the sematic highlighter works.
- (meaning pasm instruction names, built-in names, conditions, etc. are not highlighted)
- All files with debug() statements that don't use double-quoted strings can't be parsed correctly

### REPORT: Source code shipped in P2 OBEX

- For all P2 Obex files, highlighting is working with the exception of:
- FILE `Parktransformation.spin2` I'm checking the Chip as to why this is.

## [0.3.4] 2021-03-17

This adds quoted-string avoidance when looking for names and their use.

Theme Adjustments:

- Darkened storage type color slightly.

Semantic Adjustments:

- BUGFIX Spin: now ignores contents of strings
- BUGFIX Spin: debug() statements should now be parsing correctly

Syntax Adjustments:

- Incorrectly colors **built-in** constants (should be own color)
- Syntax highlight of DAT section sometimes fails... RES and FIT not colored correctly
- Semantic highlight: the 'modification' attribute is being over-applied
- Semantic highlight: the 'modification' attribute should use more than := as test!!!!
- _I'm sure there are more issues..._

## [0.3.3] 2021-03-16

4th Release of Semantic Highlighting

This represents a noticeable cleanup of parsing most existing code.

### - What's new in v0.3.3

Theme Adjustments:

- Removed `Spin2 Cluso99` theme (by request)
- Added `Spin2 Ironsheep Syntax` theme (primarily for extension developer use, disables Semantic highlighting)

**Note**: _Should you wish, you can switch between the two ironsheep themes to show code with or without semantic highlighting_

Semantic Adjustments:

- Update: VAR declarations - parses all examples in spin2 doc
- Update: CON declarations - parses all examples in spin2 doc
- Update: parses all examples shipped with PNut (less `Spin2_interpreter.spin2`)
- Update: now parses most of the P2 OBEX cleanly... still more to do tho'
- NEW: if variables are used but not (yet?) defined they'll be shown in RED
- BUGFIX: no longer marking vars within `{ }` single line comments
- BUGFIX: now handles multi-line enum declarations
- BUGFIX: now handles comma-delimited constant assignments
- BUGFIX: most if not all embedded assignment (e.g., `until ((b := rxcheck()) >= 0)`) now correct
- BUGFIX: most if not all shorter variable highlight is now working
- BUGFIX: multiple assignment LHS of := now highlighted correctly

Syntax Adjustments:

- BUGFIX improved variable index recognition - missing fewer of them now...
- ENHANCEMENT added floating point number recognition
- BUGFIX improved number recognition - recognizes asll examples in spin2 doc
- BUGFIX add missing `clkfreq_`, `_clkfreq` constant
- BUGFIX add missing `FVAR`, `FVARS` overrides

- Incorrectly colors **built-in** constants (should be own color)
- Fails to parse some debug() statements correctly
- Syntax highlight of DAT section sometimes fails... RES and FIT not colored correctly
- Semantic highlight: the 'modification' attribute is being over-applied
